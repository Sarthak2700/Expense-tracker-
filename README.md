# Expense-tracker-
The app I created is an expense management tool that addresses the challenges of tracking daily expenses, setting monthly savings goals, and monitoring financial progress. As a student, the inspiration for this app arose from the need for effective financial management during academic years, balancing student life, part-time work, and social engagements. Recognising the importance of financial discipline, the app provides a simple yet robust solution for fellow students and young professionals facing similar challenges. 
It incorporates expense tracking, daily logs, and a savings goal module to meet diverse financial needs. This initiative is a practical application of entrepreneurship principles learned in classrooms, involving problem identification, solution devising, and the creation of a user-friendly product. As an aspiring entrepreneur, this experience provides practical insights into app development, user experience design, and the intricacies of financial management software, fostering a sense of responsibility to contribute to a broader community seeking financial empowerment.
